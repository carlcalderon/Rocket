## Installation and Update

Firstly, you will need [node.js][nodejs] version 0.8.2 or higher. Once installed, run the following command:

    sudo git clone -b "deploy" https://github.com/carlcalderon/Rocket.git /usr/local/lib/rocket; sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/rocket/rocket /usr/local/bin/rocket

This will install Rocket to your user directory and make it available everywhere.

To update Rocket, open up the terminal and run:

    rocket --update
